## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

I built this app using the NASA API and fetch. I originally started this project off with a user input, but wanted to improve it by adding the ability to get a random date. This took me down a *whole* rabbit hole on the Date object and it's methods and properties. I finally figured out how to make that work well. Overall, I feel pretty proud of this simple app!

## Lessons Learned:

One of my first projects fetching APIs and handling the data returned. I feel like APIs and pulling data from other sources was a bit of a light bulb moment for me. It felt *so awesome* to be able to use data in a project that I didn't have to pull together myself.
